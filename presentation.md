# What is state management? What is Redux?

Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces. 

# What are benefits from Redux? 

With Redux thereâ€™s one general state in the store and each component has access to the state. This eliminates the need to continuously pass state from one component to another.

When using Redux with React, states will no longer need to be lifted up, hence it makes it easier for you to trace which action causes any change.
