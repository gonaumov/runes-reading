<h1 id="reactjs-what-is-it-and-what-is-not">ReactJS what is it and what is not?</h1>

<p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) 
is a JavaScript library for building user 
interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook 
and a community of individual developers 
and companies. ReactJS is a library. Not monolith framework.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-we-load-css-and-how-we-make-dom-manipulations">How do we load CSS and how we make DOM manipulations?</h1>

<p>Loading css with create react app is very easy. 
We also can use sass. Let’s do it. 
Usually we don’t need to use DOM manipulations 
at all but with refs API we can do it.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-state-management-what-is-redux">What is state management? What is Redux?</h1>

<p>Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces.</p>

<section class="slide " id="5">
  <!-- _S9SLIDE_ -->
<h1 id="what-are-benefits-from-redux">What are benefits from Redux?</h1>

<p>With Redux there’s one general state in the store and each component has access to the state. This eliminates the need to continuously pass state from one component to another.</p>

<p>When using Redux with React, states will no longer need to be lifted up, hence it makes it easier for you to trace which action causes any change.</p>
